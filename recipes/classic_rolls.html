    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These irresistible dinner rolls are fluffy, buttery, and just a little bit sweet for a delicious flavor combination. No one will be able to say no to these dinner rolls — especially when they're warm right out of the oven.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter (for brushing)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm milk. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine sugar, melted butter, salt, and egg. Mix in the yeast mixture. Gradually add flour, mixing until a soft dough forms. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Punch down the dough. Divide dough into 12 equal pieces and shape each piece into a ball. Place rolls in a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake rolls in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and brush tops with melted butter.</li>
    </ol>
