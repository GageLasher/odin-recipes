    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 box brownie mix (plus ingredients called for on the box)</li>
        <li>1 cup chocolate frosting</li>
        <li>1 cup candy corn</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mini chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/2 cup red and orange M&M's</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white frosting</li>
        <li>Black decorating gel</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven according to brownie mix instructions. Prepare brownie mix as directed on the box. Pour batter into a greased 9x13 inch baking pan and bake as directed. Allow brownies to cool completely.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Once cooled, cut brownies into small squares (about 2 inches). These will be the bodies of the turkeys.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Spread a generous amount of chocolate frosting on top of each brownie square.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Insert candy corn pieces around the back edge of each brownie to create the turkey's feathers.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Use mini chocolate chips for the eyes, placing them on the front of the brownie. Use red and orange M&M's for the beak and wattle, attaching them with a small dab of frosting.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Use white frosting to create a small dot on each chocolate chip for added detail in the eyes. Use black decorating gel to add pupils to the eyes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Let the frosting set for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy your mini brownie turkeys!</li>
    </ol>
